First of all you need to install python on your computer

First create A Telegram Bot Using BotFather

The very first thing we need to do would be to create a Telegram Bot, and we can do this using BotFather (Search “BotFather” in your search bar)


Type /newbot to tell BotFather that you wish to create a new Telegram bot
Choose a name and username for your Telegram bot
A token will be generated for your newly created Telegram bot — We will need this in our code later
Note: please don’t share your Telegram bot token with anyone — anyone with your token can take over control of your Telegram bot.

Now replace the token in telegarm.py with our own token.

After that in the codeforces.py fill the usernames and then run the script.
